# Internship P3
This will be my 3rd intership period where I talk about what is new and what I do.

## Theme
### Layout
For desktop I'm thinking about examp2 and [Medium](https://medium.com/better-programming/link-previews-more-than-meets-the-eye-aa13c77c6d69) article. For mobile layout I'm thinking more about examp1.png Put a menu on the left as examp2.png, and make mobile menu a standerd hamburger. Add illustrations like examp1.png.
### Colors
The primary color should be a version of blue #1E87FD with a softer version of #E0EBFD, and white and blue grayish. The accent color should be Otys yellow #FFD300.
### Fun stuff
* Might be fun to add a theme switch: light, dark, auto. The standar should be auto which switches between light and dark based on time.
* Have a little cms with a login. Add a [markdown editor](https://simplemde.com/) and a [markdown parser](https://parsedown.org/). split up sections with different markdown fields and give those sections the title of that section from the database.
